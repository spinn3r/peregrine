- don't run reduce as the keys won't necessarily be grouped.  Is this a map only job?

- map output has sorted keys already which makes reduce faster.

- files aren't needed between iterations... remove them to avoid replication
  from needing to kick in.

- map files include a schema header

- snappy should only compress data sent to distant nodes...
