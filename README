### Step 1. Installing Awestruct

Your system must have a working Ruby installation because Awestruct is written in Ruby.  You can install Awestruct using the `gem` command:

    $ gem install awestruct disqus rb-fsevent -- --with-cflags=-w

### Step 3. Making Changes and Testing

Modify the web site files as you wish.

To test locally, start the embedded web server using Awestruct.

    $ cd peregrine-website
    $ awestruct --auto --server

The web site will be available at `http://localhost:4242/`

When the embedded Awestruct web server is running, changes you make will trigger a re-generation of the web site. Wait for this to complete before refreshing your browser to see your changes.
