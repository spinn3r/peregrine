Multiple things to cleanup in our refactor.


- I ned to make 100% certain that I don't confuse the separation between the
  controller and the membership (online, gossip, etc).  The PFSD should not have
  access to the membership information.

- Cleanup MultiOutputStream to use JUST pipelines

- NO usage of java.net.URL anywhere... 

- remove redundant priority queue work.

- All IO need to use one thread and never block... there are some blocking
  operations in there now suck as writing to the queue which we first need to
  see if it is at capacity AFTER a write then setReadable( false ) then call
  setReadable( true ) after a read works.

- Unit tests for failed HttpClient requests that lock up when
  connecting to a failed machine.
