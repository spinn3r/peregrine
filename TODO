    - MapOutputBuffer needs to be synchronized becuase for SOME reason it ends
      up corupted.  This defeats the whole point of being parallel.

    - Unit test to run full map and reduce phase... 


- FIXME: I need to now create some unit tests that verify the correct design:

    - writes to muliple chunk files
    - make sure chunk files get schedule for execution on the correct CPU/thread
    - verify that algorithm execution is correct
