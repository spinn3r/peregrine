title Shuffle flush

Controller->+Worker: <<flush(name)>>
note right of Worker:
Controller tells the worker to flush
with the explicit 'name' of a shuffle
target.  The Worker replies with
200 OK to note that the request
was accepted.
end note
Worker->-Controller: <<reportFlushStatus(name,success,cause)>>
note left of Controller:
The controller is now notified of
all pending flushes.  Operations can
continue now that the system has
accepted all flushes.  The `name`
param is the name of the shuffle
target being flushed.  The `success`
param is the status (true if we are
successful), and the cause field is
a Throwable with the cause of why
have failed.
