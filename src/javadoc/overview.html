<p style="text-align: justify;">Peregrine is a mapreduce framework designed for running iterative jobs across partitions of data. Peregrine is designed primarily for iterative map reduce
applications which need to join against the the previous iteration.  For example, algorithms like Pagerank and k-means are iterative and join against data from the previous iteration. </p>
